# Eye_Mouse_Controller
EyeMouse is a personal project that lets you control your computer's cursor using eye detection. It uses Python, Mediapipe, OpenCV, and pyautogui to make your computer respond to your eye movements. Not only can you move the cursor with your eyes, but also blink to trigger a click action. 

Dependencies:
Opencv, MediaPipe, and PyautoGui

Once you install these libraries you are good to go. You can just run the code and play around with it and it'd run flawlessly.
